# svg-logo-maker
## Description
- My motivation for this project was to build an application that could generate a custom logo based on questions answered by the user.
- I built this project to have an easy way to generate simple logos.
- This application solves the problem of having a simple logo without created for the user, without the need for photoshop or other programs.
- I learned how to use jest to test my code, OOP to inherit class properties, and how to have a better file structure when working on more 
  complex applications.
